# City Trip Planner
  Bachelor thesis presented in 2021 at the end of my studies at the Faculty of Computer Science Iasi.
  The application revolves around the idea of planning itineraries for a given city.
  The implementation was made using the Spring Boot framework for the backend part, together with Alpinejs and Tailwind for the frontend part.
  The planification of itineraries is determined by a constraint programming algorithm, written with the aid of the library Choco-solver.
  
  A live demo of the application can be found at the [address](https://citytripplanner.herokuapp.com/)
